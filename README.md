Food Truck Project

##Description
This project prompts a user to enter up to 5 different food trucks, the type of food they sell and the rating on a scale from 1 - 5. Then user will then go to a menu screen where they will have 4 options. The options will print out either all the food trucks in the array, the average rating of the food trucks, the highest rated food truck, or to quit the program.

##Lessons Learned
I really struggled with adding variables into an array from a scanner. I ended up creating variables that I could store the information from the scanner. I then added all items into the array at once.

I didn't understand how to utilize my getters and setters at first, but once I realized how to call them in a different class it really helped me figure out my problems such as getting the highest rated food truck.
